2165,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,"Use ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (UF/RO) for wastewater cleaning. When the water-based paint is used, processing equipment must be regularly cleaned with water. A typical painting operation requires significant amount of water to clean, all of it must be disposed of as hazardous waste. Reducing this hazardous waste therefore reduces transportation and incineration energy associated with its removal. A combined UF/RO process cleans wastewater to the point where it is again suitable for cleaning purpose. The UF/RO can recover 95% of the waste water."
2184,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,Select shielding gas with reduced fume generation for the GMAW and Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) processes. Argon-based shielding gases with the lowest percentages of oxygen or carbon dioxide will minimize fume for both GMAW and FCAW. The fume generation rate can be cut almost in half by changing from 100% CO2 shielding gas to a mixture of Argon with 25% CO2 shielding gas. A further reduction in fume generation rate can be achieved by use of a shielding gas containing Argon with only 5% CO2 along with the appropriate electrode
